Notes for MATH 4B (Differential Equations) at UC Santa Barbara.

# Acknowledgements
These notes are heavily based on [Paul's Online Math Notes](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/DE/DE.aspx). This is an incredible resource for differential equations, multivariate calculus, and more. Most of the examples in my notes are taken from Paul's notes, though some are modified.

My notes and solutions to examples are written quite verbosely, being careful not to skip small but important steps. I find this helpful, and hopefully you do too. Others may find the level of detail excessive.
