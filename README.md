Notes for MATH 4B (Differential Equations) at UC Santa Barbara.

# Acknowledgements
These notes were heavily inspired – and based off of – [Paul's Online Math Notes](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/DE/DE.aspx). This is an incredible resource for differential equations, multivariate calculus, and more.

Most of the examples in my notes are taken from Paul's notes, though some were modified. My notes and solutions to examples are written quite verbosely, being careful not to skip small but important steps. This is helpful to me, and may be helpful to some. Others may find the level of detail in my notes to be excessive.
